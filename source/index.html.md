# Developing GOV.UK registers

This is internal technical documentation for the [GOV.UK Registers service](https://registers.service.gov.uk), built by the Government Digital Service (GDS). For other projects built by GDS, see the [Service Toolkit](https://www.gov.uk/service-toolkit).

For information on integrating with GOV.UK registers, see the [GOV.UK registers technical documentation](https://docs.registers.service.gov.uk/#gov-uk-registers-technical-documentation).
